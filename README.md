# CACaWeT  
CACaWeT is an analysis tool dedicated to process non steady signals: earthquake, shock...  
It is based on complex Cauchy continuous wavelet. The GUI of the class contains  
- time-history analysis : seismic hazard indicators,
- Frequency analysis: S-DOF response spectra (acceleration, velocity and displacement spectra), Fourier Transform analysis,
- Time-frequency analysis based multi-resolution wavelet analysis. In this cas, it is possible to carry out OMA with output-only and EMA when excitation motion and output motion are both known.
